# Kubernetes Setup

This was done by using `kubeadm` and following steps [in](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm/):

1. [install docker kubeadm and kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/#before-you-begin)
2. [create the cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm/)
