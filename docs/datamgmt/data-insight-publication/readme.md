# Data insight publication

In order to allow the publication of insights arising from data analysis activities, the DAF platform provide a specific Web Application: the *Data Portal* is a web based user interface for the DAF, giving users the capabilities to access to DAF functionalities and data products. The Data Portal will expand the typical features of the popular data catalogues (e.i. dati.gov.it) with the following:

- **Data Visualization Templates**: they are modules that generate a specific data visualization based on a data source specified. They will give the user the possibility to use an already implemented standard visualizations (i.e. line graph, bar chart, pie chart, etc.) or to create his own graph in d3.js (or any other javascript graph libraries supported), and they will natively integrate with the DAF api exposing data. Data Visualization Template are also managed by their CMS, to help for search and reusability.

- **Data Stories**: they are entities containing stories and analysis about a specific phenomena described with data, and can be made of text, Data Visualization objects, notebooks, gists/github resources. They are basically the way users create data related content in the Data Portal.

- **Social & Collaboration**: Users can create their own Data Stories and share them on the platform so other users can read and/or fork them to build a new Data Story on top of an existing one.

- **User Profile**: a restricted area where the user can see and manage the content she created, as well as have access to personal data that are available in DAF (i.e. the citizen dashboard). The latter functionality will be accessed with a 2nd/3rd level SPID, meanwhile for the first part a lighter registration may be enough.
