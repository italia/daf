# Datasets & Metadata in DAF
Dataset is the most important entity designed and implemented in DAF. Datasets can be of three types: Standard, Ordinary and Raw. As anticipated above, the three types of datasets have different sets of rules and info required, more stringent for the Standard datasets, less for Ordinary, lower for Raw. Here we describe the conceptual framework used to manage the schema and metadata system, and we'll explain the role and characteristics of the three types.

## Metadata and Catalogue Manager
DAF has an internal module to manage the creation, management and usage of Datasets, called **Catalogue Manager**. A Dataset is an *entity* that has a number of attributes (that we will call metadata from now on for the sake of simplicity) that characterize it and allow the system to perform automatic operations on them. Metadata are of three macro types in DAF:
- **DCATAP**: it contains metadata informations characterizing the 'semantics' of the dataset. Here are contained info about theme and category of the topic described in the dataset, geographic location info, who produced the dataset, its title and description, and so on. DCATAP refers to the [Data Catalogue Application Profile](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/dcat_application_profile/description).   
You'll find the [DCATAP schema here](https://github.com/bianchi74/daf/blob/master/docs/datamgmt/metadata/md-dcatapit.json) and an [example application here](https://github.com/bianchi74/daf/blob/master/docs/datamgmt/metadata/example/data-dcatapit.json)
- **DataSchema**: it contains a modified AVRO format data schema of the dataset, with information about the features and the associated type, optional constraints on the values that the features can take, as well as semantic information, optional theme and categories of each features.  
You'll find the [DataSchema schema here](https://github.com/bianchi74/daf/blob/master/docs/datamgmt/metadata/md-dataschema.json) and an [example application here](https://github.com/bianchi74/daf/blob/master/docs/datamgmt/metadata/example/data-dataschema.json)
- **Operational**: here back-end related info are stored, such as: dataset uri, physical storage url, Standard Schema conversion, transformation pipeline, associated API for retrieval and ingestion, etc.  
You'll find the [Operational schema here](https://github.com/bianchi74/daf/blob/master/docs/datamgmt/metadata/md-operational.json) and an [example application here](https://github.com/bianchi74/daf/blob/master/docs/datamgmt/metadata/example/data-operational.json)
